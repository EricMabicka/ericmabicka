### About Me

Hello! I'm Eric Mabicka, a data analyst based in Zurich, Switzerland.  
With a background in Applied Economics and a deep curiosity for how societies function, I use data to help organizations make smarter, evidence-based decisions.

My journey into data began with academic research and policy analysis, working with public institutions to uncover social, economic, and demographic insights. Over time, I realized my strongest drive was not just understanding systems—but using data to improve them. That realization led me to hone technical skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel, combining statistical rigor with effective communication.

In addition to my analytical work, I’ve taught economics and led research projects in the public sector, which sharpened both my communication skills and data literacy. This experience allows me to approach data with both strategic perspective and hands-on capability.

I’m passionate about turning complex information into clear, actionable insights. Whether through visualizations, storytelling, or teaching, I strive to make data useful, relevant, and impactful.
